C. General Description:
-----------------------

    This code implements the LSTM-ER model in [1], based on [2], to classify
    relations between argument components in a document. The LSTM-ER is derived
    from the N-ary treeLSTM architecture found in [3].  The relation extraction
    (RE) module in [2] utilizes the treeLSTM to process a sentence over its
    dependency tree. The dependency tree in nature has a varying number of
    children. However, N-ary design needs a fixed number of child nodes. For
    example, in [3], the N-ary tree is used with constituency binary-tree where
    each node has a left and a right child node.

    In [2], the dependency tree nodes are categorized into two classes: the
    shortest-path nodes are one class, and the other nodes are the second class.
    Nodes that belong to the same class share the same weights. As indicated in
    [4], the shortest path between two entities in the same sentence contains
    all the  information required to identify those relationships. However, as
    stated in [1], 92% of argument components' relationships are across
    different sentences. We cannot identify the path that encodes all the
    required information to identify the relationships between two arguments
    components across different sentences.

E. TreeLSTMCell Impelementation:
--------------------------------
    For each parent node, `message_func` sends the children's information to
    `reduce_func` function . The following info is sent:
    h:      child nodes' hiddens state      Size: (Nt, Nchn, H)
    c:      child nodes' cell state         Size: (Nt, Nchn, H)
    type_n: child nodes' type               Size: (Nt, Nchn)

    The data is retained in `nodes.mailbox`. The return of `reduce_func`
    function is then sent to the next function, `apply_node_func`.

    We receive h and c in a tensor of size (Nt, Nchn, H). Because the
    number of children in the batch may vary, the `reduce_function`
    collects/groups the information according to the `Nchn` dim. It
    calls itself iteratively to process each group separately.  The
    function then stacks the results vetically and sends them. Thus,
    the dimensions other than Dimension(0) (i.e Nt) must be equal to each
    other. Also, the final number of rows, Dimension(0), after stacking must be
    equal to the number of nodes (batch size); i.e. Nt = number of parent nodes.

    For the leaf nodes, where there is no childen, the code starts at
    `apply_node_func`, The hidden state is initialized, then the the gates
    values are calculated

    E1. The forget gate eqn:
    -----------------------
        Assuming the following:
        1. For nodes in a graph [Ng], the number of nodes = n
        2. For node-t ∈ Ng & 1<=t<=N:
            a. Child nodes of node-t is [Nct]

            b. number of children of node-t: Nchn(t) = ℓ,
            For an arbitry node (node-r), r ≠ t and r ∈ [Ng]: Nchn(r) may not
            be equal to ℓ

            c. the hidden states for the child nodes htl = [hi] where
            1 <= i <= ℓ.
            Each child node is either of type_n0 or type_n1;
            the hidden state for typn_0 is h_t0 and for type_n1 is
            h_t1, where
            h_t0 = Sum([h0])= Sum( [hi | 1 <= j <= ℓ & m(j)=type_n0] )
            h_t1 = Sum([h1])= Sum( [hi | 1 <= j <= ℓ & m(j)=type_n1] )

            e. Node-t have ℓ forget gates; a gate for each child node

        In [1] eqn 4, the second part of the forget gate (Sum(U*h)) could
        be written as follows:
            - For each node-k in the child nodes: The forget gate
            (ftk, 1 <= k <= ℓ) is
            either a type_0 (f0) or (f1).  where:
            f0 = U00 h_t0 + U01 h_t1,  eq(a)
            f1 = U10 h_t0 + U11 h_t1   eq(b)

    E2. i,o,u eqn:
    --------------
        For node_t:
        i_t = U_i0 . h_t0 + U_i1 . h_t1   eq(c)
        o_t = U_o0 . h_t0 + U_o1 . h_t1   eq(d)
        u_t = U_u0 . h_t0 + U_u1 . h_t1   eq(e)

    E3. Example:
    -------------
        - Assuming a node-t = node-1 in a graph:
        - node-1 have 4 child nodes: Nct=[n1, n2, n3, n4].
        - The types of child nodes are as follows [0, 1, 1, 0]
        - Ignoring the fixed parts in the forget gates' equation: Wx & b:
            * the forget gate for each child node will be as follows:
                For node-k that is child of node-t:
                ftk = Um(tk)m(tl) * htl,
                where: tl ∈ Nct, 1 <= tl < 4 & m(lt)=is either 0 or 1
        - For each child node, the equations are:
            child-node-1: f11 = U00 h11 + U01 h12 + U01 h13 + U00 h14
            child-node-2: f12 = U10 h11 + U11 h12 + U11 h13 + U10 h14
            child-node-3: f13 = U10 h11 + U11 h12 + U11 h13 + U10 h14
            child-node-4: f14 = U00 h11 + U01 h12 + U01 h13 + U00 h14
            child-node-5: f15 = U10 h11 + U11 h12 + U11 h13 + U10 h14

        - The equation of child-node 1,4 (type_n0) are equal to each
            other, the same are for child nodes 2,3, (type_n1).

        - Further reduction can be done as follows:
            forget type_0: f0 = U00 (h11 + h14) + U01 (h12 + h13)
            forget type_1: f1 = U10 (h11 + h14) + U11 (h12 + h13)
            h_t0 = (h11 + h14)
            h_t1 = (h12 + h13), see section E1.c above.

            f0 = U00 h_t0 + U01 h_t1
            f1 = U10 h_t0 + U11 h_t1
            where ht_0 is hidden states for type_n0 child nodes and ht_1 is
            hidden states for type_n1 child nodes.

    E4. Impelemntation:
    --------------------
        Step:1 Get ht_0 anf ht_1:
        *************************
            1. Get hidden states for each node type: ht_0, ht_1
                a. Get nodes that are belong to each node type
                    (type: 0 & 1)
                b. Get h and c for each node type "ht_0, ht_1"
                c. If there is no specific node type,
                    the respective ht_0 or ht_1 is zeros

        Step:2 i,o,t gates: based on eqs(c,d,e) Under section D:
        **************************************************
            a. [ht_0, ht_1] [   Uiot   ] = [i, o, t]
                (Nt , 2H)   (2H , 3H)   = (Nt , 3H)

            b. `reduce_func` return [i, o, t]

        Step:3 Forget gate: based on eqs(a,b) Under section C:
        ************************************************
            a. [ht_0, ht_1] [    Uf    ] =  [f0, f1]
                (Nt , 2H)     (2H , 2H)  =  (Nt , 2H)

            b. Then, construct a tensor f_cell (Nt, Nchn, H) ,
                where each tensor at (Nt, Nchn) is either
                f_0 or f_1 according to the type of the respective
                child node. for the example in section C the matrix
                f_cell (1, 4, H) = [f0; f1; f1; f0]

            c. f_tk = sigma( W X_emb + f_cell + b)
                The size of f_tk, [W X_emb] and f_cell = (Nt, Nchn, H)
                The size of b is (1, H)

            d. c_cell = SUM(mailbox(c) . f_tk) over Dimension(Nchn)
                The size of c mailbox(c) = size of f_tk
                c_cell size = (Nt, H)

            e. return c_cell
