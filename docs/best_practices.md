## Dataset

    - Be weary of using dataset which come partly preprocessed.


## Layer Dimensionality 




## Activations




## Shuffling

    - shuffle each epoch



## Metrics





## Training Tips

    - Early Stopping
        - Reduce overfitting

    - Gradient Clipping
        Useful in RNNS
    

    - Learning Rate scheduling


    - Dropout
        - reduce overfitting
        - prevent Features co-adapting ( a feature can only be useful in the presence of a particular other feature??!?)


## OOV
    

    - Create a vocabulary from a cropus which is not the Dataset itself. E.g. BNC or ...

    - Use Byte-Pair encoding vocabulary instead of token vocabulary


## Word Embeddings
